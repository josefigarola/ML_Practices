## Name: [Linear Regression](LinearRegression.ipynb)

## What is Linear Regression?
Linear regression is a statistical method used in machine learning and statistics to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting straight line (the regression line) that represents the relationship between the variables.

# Name:  [Breast Cancer Analysis](BreastCancer.ipynb)

## Project Type: Unsupervised Learning Technique: Clustering

## What is clustering?
Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects
in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense)
to each other than to those in other groups (clusters).


# Name: [Twitter Sentiment Analysis](SentimentAnalysis.ipynb)

## Project Type: Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## What is NLP?
creation of computational models that process and understand natural language. These include: making the computer understand the semantic grouping of words (e.g. cat and dog are semantically more similar than cat and spoon), text to speech, language translation and many more

## What is Sentiment Analysis?
It is the interpretation and classification of emotions (positive, negative and neutral) within text data using text analysis techniques. Sentiment analysis allows organizations to identify public sentiment towards certain words or topics.
