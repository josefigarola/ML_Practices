## What is Linear Regression?
Linear regression is a statistical method used in machine learning and statistics to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting straight line (the regression line) that represents the relationship between the variables.
