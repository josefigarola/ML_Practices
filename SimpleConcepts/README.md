## What is Linear Regression?
Linear regression is a statistical method used in machine learning and statistics to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting straight line (the regression line) that represents the relationship between the variables.

## What is Gradient Descent?
Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest decrease (negative gradient) of the function with respect to its parameters. It is commonly used in machine learning for training models, particularly in the context of minimizing the cost or loss function associated with the model.
